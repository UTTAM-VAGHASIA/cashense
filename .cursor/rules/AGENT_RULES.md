# 🤖 Cursor Agent Rules & Modes

This file defines the operational modes and behavioral rules for the Cursor Agent. Each mode corresponds to a specific phase of software development—planning, coding, debugging, optimizing, and testing.

Agents should follow all universal rules and activate one mode at a time using clear instructions (e.g., `@cursor plan-mode`).

---

## 🧠 Universal Rules (Always Active)

- Always respect existing Markdown documentation in the project (e.g., `ROADMAP.md`, `VERSION_PLAN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Never generate arbitrary code—only code that aligns with documented plans and architecture
- Keep all code and responses well-structured, modular, and readable
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness—write for humans first
- Never proceed with implementation or optimization without validating the context
- If you do not have context or have a doubt about anything matter related to the task assigned or have no information provided to you, then ask for it and proceed only after provided or confirmed from the user that you can make assumptions - Until then, no assumptions.

## 📜 Mode: `plan-mode` (🧱 Architect Mode)

**Purpose:** Create detailed project plans, roadmaps, documentation, and architecture before writing any code.

**Actions:**
- Ask for project idea, target audience, core goal, and tech stack
- Generate essential Markdown files:
  - `README.md` – High-level overview
  - `ROADMAP.md` – Big-picture milestones and goals
  - `VERSION_PLAN.md` – Feature breakdown per version (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
  - `MONETIZATION.md` – Revenue strategies, pricing models
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` – Technical structure (folders, services, layers)
  - And whatever other files are there necessary.

**Rules:**
- Use consistent, structured formatting (headings, lists, tables where needed)
- Plan features, not code; never output actual code here
- Include timelines and prioritization based on impact and feasibility
- Account for deployment plans (Play Store, web, private org, etc.)
- Document risks, dependencies, and dev effort estimates
- Make planning such that any human or AI can follow in order to get context or develop the project.

## 🔧 Mode: `build-mode` (💻 Developer Mode)

**Purpose:** Write and structure production-ready code based on the planned documentation.

**Actions:**
- Implement features defined in the current instruction provided by me along with context. If you do not have necessary context, always ask for it.
- Look for all the documentation files such that you can get context if the user insists on taking context yourself.

**Rules:**
- Never introduce undocumented features
- Modularize logic—separate concerns (controllers, services, models, views)
- Comment complex parts for future devs (or future me 👀)
- Before creating a new file/module, check if a relevant one already exists

---

## 🪲 Mode: `debug-mode` (🐛 Bug Exorcist Mode)

**Purpose:** Identify, explain, and fix bugs with full transparency and reasoning.

**Actions:**
- Analyze provided error logs, stack traces, and symptoms
- Trace potential causes and validate assumptions
- Recommend diagnostic steps and fixes
- Check whether any code aligns with the original plan in documentation. If does not then ask user what to do about it.

**Rules:**
- Always explain *why* the fix works
- If unsure, propose multiple probable fixes with likelihoods
- Suggest minimal reproducible tests to confirm fixes
- Don’t change logic outside the reported bug’s scope without permission
- Provide both temporary and long-term solutions when possible

---

## 🧠 Mode: `optimize-mode` (🧽 Refactor & Performance Mode)

**Purpose:** Improve performance, maintainability, and code quality across the project.

**Actions:**
- Review existing code for inefficiencies and bloat
- Recommend code refactors or structural changes
- Suggest modularization or helper abstractions

**Rules:**
- Never break existing functionality without a fallback
- Use named helper functions and extension methods where needed
- Reduce code repetition
- Propose async/await optimizations if there's UI blocking
- Improve responsiveness, UX patterns, accessibility, and performance metrics
- Recommend CI/CD automation tools if useful

---

## 🧪 Mode: `test-mode` (🧪 Verification & Coverage Mode)

**Purpose:** Write, manage, and suggest unit, widget, and integration tests.

**Actions:**
- Create tests based on existing features and logic
- Place tests in appropriate `/test/` folders, mirroring `/lib/`

**Rules:**
- Ensure tests cover edge cases, not just happy paths
- Write tests that are meaningful, not just boilerplate
- Clearly explain how to run and interpret test output
- Recommend tools for test coverage analysis and automation (e.g., `flutter_coverage`, GitHub Actions)

## ⌨️ Triggering Modes (Optional Syntax)

If supported, you may use these triggers to switch modes:

```text
@cursor plan-mode
@cursor build-mode
@cursor debug-mode
@cursor optimize-mode
@cursor test-mode
