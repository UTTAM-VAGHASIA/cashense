- ✅ IDE configuration (.cursor, .idea folders)

### 2. Strategic Project Setup and Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Flutter project structure established following clean architecture
- ✅ pubspec.yaml configured with comprehensive dependencies:
  - Core Flutter framework (^3.8.1)
  - Riverpod state management (^2.6.1)
  - Complete Firebase suite (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics, Messaging, Functions)
  - Local storage solutions (Hive ^2.2.3, flutter_secure_storage ^4.2.1)
  - Navigation with go_router (^16.0.0)
  - UI components and charting (fl_chart, flutter_form_builder)
  - Localization support (flutter_localizations, intl)
  - Currency handling (currency_picker ^2.0.21, money2 ^6.0.3)
  - Network and utilities (dio ^5.8.0+1, flutter_tts ^4.2.3)
  - Code generation tools (build_runner, freezed, json_serializable, hive_generator)
- ✅ Development tools configuration:
  - Build runner for code generation
  - Linting with flutter_lints ^6.0.0
  - Asset organization structure
  - Localization generation setup
- 🔄 Firebase project setup (pending configuration)
- 🔄 Environment-specific configuration files
