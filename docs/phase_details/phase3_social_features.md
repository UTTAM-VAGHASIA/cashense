# Phase 3: Social Features

## Overview
The Social Features phase extends Cashense from an individual finance app to a collaborative financial tool. This phase implements group expense splitting, debt tracking, and multi-workspace functionality, enabling users to manage finances with friends, family, and colleagues.

## Timeline
**Duration**: 6 weeks (Weeks 13-18)

## Key Features
1. **Group Expenses** - Add and split expenses with friends/family
2. **Debt Tracker** - Money lent/borrowed tracking
3. **Multi-Workspace** - Separate spaces for personal/business finances
4. **Smart Settlement** - Auto debt clearing within groups

## Detailed Milestones

- Implement group creation and management
- Build member invitation and permissions system
- Create shared account visualization
- Develop group activity feed

#### Technical Implementation Details
- Create Group and GroupMember models

- Ensuring data isolation while maintaining performance
- Edge cases in expense splitting calculations
- Managing synchronization across multiple users
- Handling conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Next Steps
Upon completion, we'll move to Phase 4 to implement AI integration features.
