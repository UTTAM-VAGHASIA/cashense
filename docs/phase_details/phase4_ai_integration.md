# Phase 4: AI Integration

## Overview
The AI Integration phase enhances Cashense with intelligent features powered by natural language processing and voice capabilities. During this 5-week period, we'll implement conversational interfaces, voice commands, and smart financial assistants to make finance management more intuitive.

## Timeline
**Duration**: 5 weeks (Weeks 19-23)

## Key Features
1. **Natural Language Interface** - Text-based transaction entry and queries
2. **Voice Commands** - Hands-free operation for common tasks
3. **Smart Classification** - AI-powered categorization of transactions
4. **Financial Assistant** - Personalized financial recommendations
5. **Intelligent Reminders** - Context-aware notifications and alerts
