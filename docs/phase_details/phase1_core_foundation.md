# Phase 1: Core Foundation

## Overview
The Core Foundation phase establishes the fundamental architecture and essential features of Cashense. During this 6-week period, we'll build the basic account structure, transaction management system, and essential synchronization capabilities.

## Timeline
**Duration**: 6 weeks (Weeks 1-6)

## Key Features
1. **Accounts & Sub-Accounts** - Basic structure with wallet, bank, and custom accounts
2. **Expense Tracking** - Simple transaction logging with categories
3. **Cash & Manual Handling** - Basic cash transaction tracking
4. **Multi-Device Sync** - Core data synchronization
5. **Offline Support** - Basic offline functionality

## Detailed Milestones

### Milestone 1.1: Project Setup (Week 1)
- Set up Flutter project with FVM for version management
- Configure Supabase backend services
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Create basic app structure and navigation
- Implement authentication (email, social login)

#### Technical Implementation Details
- Initialize Flutter project using FVM version 3.x
- Set up Supabase tables with PostgreSQL
- Configure user authentication with email and social providers
- Implement secure token storage and refresh mechanism
- Create bottom navigation with main app sections

### Milestone 1.2: Account Structure (Week 2)
- Design database schema for accounts and sub-accounts
- Implement account creation and management UI
- Create account types (bank, wallet, cash, credit)
- Build account linking relationships and hierarchy
- Develop account balance calculation logic

#### Technical Implementation Details
- Create Account and SubAccount models with appropriate relationships
- Implement Supabase database tables with appropriate constraints
- Build UI for account creation and management
- Develop balance calculation service that handles nested accounts
- Create database queries for account aggregation and filtering

### Milestone 1.3: Transaction Management (Weeks 3-4)
- Design transaction data model and database schema
- Create transaction entry forms with category selection
- Build transaction list view with filtering options
- Implement category management system
- Develop cash tracking with denomination options

#### Technical Implementation Details
- Create Transaction model with date, amount, account, category fields
- Build transaction entry UI with form validation
- Implement transaction list with filtering and sorting
- Create category management system with presets and customization
- Develop cash denomination tracking for cash accounts

### Milestone 1.4: Sync & Offline Support (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement data synchronization across devices
- Build conflict resolution mechanism
- Create local storage for offline operation
- Develop background sync when connection restored
- Test multi-device scenarios extensively

#### Technical Implementation Details
- Implement Supabase realtime subscriptions for live updates
- Create local database using Hive or Isar for offline storage
- Build synchronization service with conflict resolution
- Develop background sync service using Flutter background tasks
- Create comprehensive test suite for sync scenarios

## Dependencies and Requirements
- Flutter SDK with FVM setup
- Supabase project configured
- GitHub repository with Actions setup
- Mobile devices for testing (Android and iOS)

## Success Criteria
- Users can create accounts and sub-accounts of different types
- Transactions can be logged, categorized, and viewed
- Data synchronizes between devices seamlessly
- App works offline with data syncing when connection restored
- Authentication works reliably with multiple methods

## Risks and Challenges
- Complex account hierarchy relationships
- Conflict resolution in offline sync scenarios
- Performance with large transaction datasets
- Cross-platform authentication challenges

## Next Steps
Upon completion, we'll move to Phase 2 to implement financial planning features.
