# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Cashense Flutter application from its current Clean Architecture structure (with data/domain/presentation layers) to Flutter's recommended MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. The goal is to simplify the codebase structure, reduce complexity, and make it more maintainable while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Clean Architecture to MVVM pattern, so that the codebase is simpler and follows Flutter's recommended practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the lib/ directory SHALL follow MVVM structure with models/, views/, and viewmodels/ directories
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing features SHALL maintain their functionality without breaking changes
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the new structure SHALL be easier to navigate and understand for Flutter developers
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all imports and dependencies SHALL be updated to reflect the new structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate the current three-layer architecture into MVVM, so that I can reduce code complexity and eliminate unnecessary abstractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating data models THEN entities and data models SHALL be consolidated into a single models/ directory
2. WHEN migrating business logic THEN use cases and repositories SHALL be simplified into ViewModels with direct service calls
3. WHEN migrating UI components THEN presentation layer SHALL be renamed to views/ with cleaner separation
4. WHEN migrating providers THEN Riverpod providers SHALL be integrated into ViewModels for state management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain feature-based organization within MVVM, so that related code remains grouped together logically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing features THEN each feature SHALL have its own subdirectory under models/, views/, and viewmodels/
2. WHEN organizing shared code THEN common models, views, and viewmodels SHALL be placed in respective shared directories
3. WHEN organizing services THEN core services SHALL remain in a dedicated services/ directory
4. WHEN organizing utilities THEN core utilities SHALL remain in a dedicated utils/ directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all import statements and dependencies, so that the application continues to work after the structural migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating imports THEN all relative import paths SHALL be updated to reflect new directory structure
2. WHEN updating exports THEN all barrel files SHALL be updated to export from new locations
3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN all dependency injection SHALL work with the new MVVM structure
4. WHEN updating tests THEN all test files SHALL be updated to import from new locations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing functionality during migration, so that no features are lost or broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN all authentication features SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN all transaction management features SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN all settings and configuration features SHALL work exactly as before
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN all navigation and routing SHALL work exactly as before
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN all state management SHALL work exactly as before
