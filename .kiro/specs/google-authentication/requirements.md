# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Google Sign-In authentication system for the Cashense personal finance application. The system will provide a single, streamlined authentication method across all supported platforms (Android, Web, Windows, Linux, macOS) with iOS support to be implemented later. The authentication flow will consist of a beautiful login screen followed by a welcome screen displaying the user's information after successful authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign in with my Google account so that I can securely access the Cashense application without creating a separate account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a login screen as the first and only screen
2. WHEN the login screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Sign in with Google" button prominently
3. WHEN the user taps the "Sign in with Google" button THEN the system SHALL initiate the Google OAuth flow
4. WHEN the Google OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and navigate to the welcome screen
5. IF the Google OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and remain on the login screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see my name displayed after successful login so that I know the authentication was successful and the app recognizes me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL navigate to a welcome screen
2. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the user's full name from their Google account
3. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL display a greeting message with the user's name
4. IF the user's name is not available THEN the system SHALL display a generic welcome message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any supported platform, I want the Google Sign-In to work consistently so that I can access the app regardless of which device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs on Android THEN the system SHALL support Google Sign-In using native Android authentication
2. WHEN the app runs on Web THEN the system SHALL support Google Sign-In using web-based OAuth flow
3. WHEN the app runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL support Google Sign-In using web-based OAuth flow
4. WHEN the app runs on Linux THEN the system SHALL support Google Sign-In using web-based OAuth flow
5. WHEN the app runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL support Google Sign-In using web-based OAuth flow
6. WHEN the app runs on iOS THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating iOS support is pending (to be implemented later)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login screen to be visually appealing and follow Material You design principles so that the app feels modern and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Material You design components and styling
2. WHEN the login screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the Cashense logo or branding
3. WHEN the login screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors, typography, and spacing
4. WHEN the login screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work well on different screen sizes
5. WHEN the system is in dark mode THEN the login screen SHALL adapt to dark theme colors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication state to be properly managed so that I don't have to sign in every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL persist the authentication state
2. WHEN the app is reopened and the user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL skip the login screen and go directly to the welcome screen
3. WHEN the authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user back to the login screen
4. WHEN the user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication state and return to the login screen

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging so that authentication issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate detail
2. WHEN the Google Sign-In service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
4. WHEN the user cancels the Google Sign-In flow THEN the system SHALL return to the login screen without showing an error
5. IF Firebase authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and show a generic error message to the user
